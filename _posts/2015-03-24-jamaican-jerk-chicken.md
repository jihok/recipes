# Jamaican Jerk Chicken

### Ingredients
- 8 lettuce leaves, I used Boston lettuce, but iceburg lettuce works
- 2 chicken breasts, cut into small pieces
- 1 to 2 tbsp Jamaican jerk seasoning (store bought or recipe follows)
- ¼ cup peanuts, chopped
- 3 green onions, chopped
- 2 cups coleslaw mix
- ¼ cup cilantro, roughly chopped
- 1 lime cut in slices

### Directions
- Spray a nonstick skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat.
- Sprinkle 1 or 2 tbsp of the Jamaican jerk seasoning over the chicken and toss making sure each piece is generously seasoned. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook for a few minutes, it will cook in about 5 to 7 minutes or so because pieces are fairly small.
- Make the sauce by mixing together the mayonnaise with a bit of Jamaican jerk seasoning.
- To assemble the lettuce wraps, top each lettuce leaf with some of the coleslaw mix, chicken, green onions, cilantro, peanuts and drizzle with a bit of the mayo sauce.
